## General Recommendations and Troubleshooting

The following are general recommendations and troubleshooting tips.

### Issue: VS Code - No Source Control Icon

Suggestion: If you're in VS Code, and you don't see the Source Control icon with a blue bubble, right-click on the sidebar icons, and make sure "Source Control" is checked.  

### Issue: VS Code wants to install an extension

If VS Code suggests an extension, it's often good to go ahead and try it. 
Do a search on the extension to learn more. VS Code suggestions are usually helpful.
